# Iris-Dataset-Project
## Description
This project analyzes the Iris dataset to explore the relationships between different features of Iris flowers and identify patterns among the three species: Iris-Virginica, Iris-Versicolor, and Iris-Setosa.
## Insights
The objective of this analysis was to explore the iris dataset using python to understand the relationship between features and classify the different species of iris. Our analysis revealed several key insights:

A positive correlation was observed between Sepal Length and Petal Length, with both features increasing together across the dataset.

Iris-Virginica had the highest mean Sepal Length, followed by Iris-Versicolor, and Iris-Setosa had the smallest mean Sepal Length.

The box plot analysis of Petal Length showed varying outliers:

Iris-Virginica had no outliers. Iris-Versicolor had one outlier below the minimum. Iris-Setosa had three outliers below the minimum and one outlier above the maximum.

The correlation analysis found a weak negative relationship between Sepal Width and Sepal Length, a moderate negative relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length, and strong positive relationships between Petal Length and Sepal Length, as well as between Petal Width and Sepal Length. Additionally, Sepal Width and Petal Width had a moderate negative correlation, while Petal Length and Petal Width showed almost no correlation.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization techniques can be used to gain valuable insights from the Iris dataset.
